		<h2>Simple Header</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1094292-Careers-website-hiring-positions/attachments/137107"><img   src="images/simple_header.jpg"></a>

		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>The target audience for this header will be young to middle-age professionals looking for a career or more information about the company</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'Client' and 'User' needs are similar. They both want the site navigation to be clear and the main action of viewing available jobs given high visual importance.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>This header is a very simple layout that use color to show important and active items. The color orange is a bright attention catching color but it also can be used in a professional stance because the color represents success and creativity.</p>

		<h2>Tabs</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1246775-MB-Dashboard/attachments/169434"><img src="images/tabs.jpg"></a>

		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>The target audience is computer-savvy enough to use a website to manage their information.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>Since the tabs could be used for a variety of items it is difficult to identify the 'Clients' needs. However, regardless of content it is safe to believe the 'User' wants to be able to navigate between groups of information.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The stark contrast of light and dark colors between the active/inactive tabs clearly give affordance. Proximity is shown when the tab is selected by combining the details with the tab while the other tabs have a significant spacing between them.  </p>

		<h2>Registration Form</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1478258-Registration-form?list=searches&tag=registration&offset=75"><img src="images/registration.jpg"></a>

		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>I believe this registration form could attract most demographics. However, since it lacks a social media sign-up, I feel it would be for work items not personal.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>Everyone wants the user to create an account and use the product provided.</p>

		<h2>Contact Information and Form</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1808179-Contact?list=searches&tag=contact_form&offset=25"><img src="images/contact_form.jpg"></a>
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>This contact form can work for any person trying to reach a company. It caters to older generations by providing physical contact information and to younger generations by giving an online means. </p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The needs for both groups it to have the user contact the company by the proper means set by the Client.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The form uses proximity and spacing to show similar items in a group. For example the telephone numbers are close together while the space between the email address and phone numbers is large. It uses color and image to separate physical and online contact means. The images of the map and icons like the phone enhance understanding of the written text. The use of color blue gives a feel that you can trust contacting this company. </p>

	<section id="results">
		<h2>Search Results List</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1499061-NYC-Results-List/attachments/225214"><img src="images/results_list.jpg"></a>
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>The modern design is geared towards younger demographics.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'Client' wants the user to view the details of the item and buy the product. The 'User' wants to view a summary of the items searched for so it compare with the other results. </p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The design uses icons along with text to make the meaning quicker to learn. They also point the user to the more important information. The price information and detail button are grouped together and separated from the rest of the information to show that it is the most important information. </p>

		<h2>Filter Section</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1499061-NYC-Results-List/attachments/225214"><img src="images/filter.jpg"></a>
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>The target audience could be anyone since they filter could be used for any search program.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p></p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The design groups the fields by category. It separates the groups with spacing and lines. The color green is use to indicate affordance. The update button is an anomaly. Since it is such a contrast from the other colors it pulls the user attention.</p>

		<h2>Reservation Form</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="http://themeforest.net/theme_previews/7873061-awesome-spiceone-page-restaurant-theme?index=1&url_name=awesome-spiceone-page-restaurant-theme"><img src="images/reservation_form.jpg"></a>

		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>Restaurants that require reservations would attract wealthier users looking to hold a date of business meeting. Since most older generations would directly call the restaurant this is geared towards younger or middle-age professionals.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'Client' wants the user to create a reservation. The 'User' wants to be able to easily create a reservation.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The site effectively uses red to guide the user to important and active task. It also is used because the color red increase food craving. By having few fields it encourages the user to complete that task because it will not take a lot of time.</p>

		<h2>Item Specification</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1179089-Tfingi-Second-theme/attachments/154850"><img src="images/item_specs.jpg"></a>

		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>This simple items specification could be used for any item. Because of this flexibility it could be used by a variety of demographics.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'User' needs to be able to view specifications of the item. The 'Client' wants the user to view mostly favorable details of the item.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The neutral colors and minimal design can be adapted to most websites. The large and colorful image is the focal point of the item because the rest of the component is fairly plain. The image also balances with the text making the component symmetrical.  </p>

		<h2>Order Review List</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1738235-Harvestlink-Order/attachments/280822"><img src="images/order_review.jpg"></a>
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>The target audience would be towards restaurants or other bulks buyers. It is geared towards middle-aged professional comfortable ordering online.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'Client' needs for the user to buy their products within their guidelines. The 'User' needs to be able to see their selections and edit the order.  </p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>It uses basic red and green to signify accordance. Since most users associate tables with order, the table design organizes the items.</p>

		<h2>Pricing Table</h2>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1783391-LandX-Landing-Page/attachments/292152"><img src="images/pricing.jpg"></a>
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		<p>I believe this item could be used for all persons trying to find information on a service quickly.</p>
		
		<h3>Client & User Needs</h3>
		<p>The 'Client' is wanting the user to sign-up for the various packages but has one seen as a better deal. The 'User' needs to have a quick summary of the package details and overall price. They then want easy access to sign-up.</p>
		
		<h3>Design Critique</h3>
		<p>The design uses one vibrant color to highlight the item the Client wants the user to focus on. It also uses the Gestalt Principle of proximity to define the items in each pricing package. It also has smaller spacing between the pricing tables than it does with the rest of the page indicating that they all are items to be compared with each other.</p>
